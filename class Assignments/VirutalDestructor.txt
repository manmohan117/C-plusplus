Create a base class Server. Its destructor should print "Server hardware off."
Create a derived class WebStack that inherits from Server.
In WebStack, create a constructor that prints "Allocating 10GB of RAM" and a destructor that prints "10GB RAM Released!"
The Test: In main, create a Server* s = new WebStack(); and then delete s;.
The Goal: Students must identify that the RAM is not released until they add the virtual keyword to the Server destructor.
